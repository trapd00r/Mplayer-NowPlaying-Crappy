NAME
    Mplayer::NowPlaying - Query metadata information from a running Mplayer
    process

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use Mplayer::NowPlaying qw($np_log np);

      $np_log = './mplay.log';

      my $artist = np('artist');
      my $album  = np('album');
      my $title  = np('title');

      printf("%s - %s (%s)\n", $artist, $title, $album);

DESCRIPTION
    Mplayer does not provide an API, the next best thing is to use the
    -slave option together with the ability to control it using a named
    pipe.

    Mplayer::NowPlaying exports one function, np(), that takes a single
    argument, the metadata tag to return:

      my $bitrate = np('bitrate'); # 128000

    You have to set the logfile to use. $np_log is globally exported, so you
    can do:

      $np_log = "$ENV{HOME}/.mplayer/mplayer.log";

    Valid arguments for the np() function is:

      ID_CLIP_INFO_VALUE0
      ID_CLIP_INFO_VALUE1
      ID_CLIP_INFO_VALUE2
      ID_CLIP_INFO_VALUE3
      ID_CLIP_INFO_VALUE4
      ID_CLIP_INFO_VALUE5
      ID_CLIP_INFO_VALUE6
      ID_AUDIO_BITRATE
      ID_AUDIO_CODEC     
      ID_AUDIO_FORMAT    
      ID_AUDIO_ID        
      ID_AUDIO_NCH       
      ID_AUDIO_RATE      
      ID_DEMUXER         
      ID_LENGTH          
      ID_SEEKABLE        
      ID_START_TIME       
      ID_FILENAME
