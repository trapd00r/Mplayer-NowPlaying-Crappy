=head1 NAME

Mplayer::NowPlaying - Query metadata information from a running Mplayer process

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use strict;
  use Mplayer::NowPlaying qw($np_log np);

  $np_log = './mplay.log';

  my $artist = np('artist');
  my $album  = np('album');
  my $title  = np('title');

  printf("%s - %s (%s)\n", $artist, $title, $album);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Mplayer> does not provide an API, the next best thing is to use the I<-slave> option
together with the ability to control it using a named pipe.

B<Mplayer::NowPlaying> exports one function, np(), that takes a single argument,
the metadata tag to return:

  my $bitrate = np('bitrate'); # 128000

You have to set the logfile to use. B<$np_log> is globally exported, so you can do:

  $np_log = "$ENV{HOME}/.mplayer/mplayer.log";

Valid arguments for the np() function are as follows:

  title
  artist
  album
  year
  comment
  track
  genre
  bitrate
  codec
  format
  id
  channels
  chapters
  demuxer
  length
  seekable
  start
  file

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

You might want to consider aliasing mplayer, since it needs the -identify
switch.

  alias mplayer="mplayer -identify $@> $HOME/.mplayer/mylog.log"
